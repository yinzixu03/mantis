Explanation of the files:  
-
    gif.m             transforms the images into a gif  
    video.m           transforms the images into a video  
    ws_main.m         extracts the main points of the mantis  
    ws_calc.m         calculates the data  
    location.mat      the main points of the mantis  
    cfit_Fourier.mat  the results calculated by cftool
